tours
=====
Masters thesis project inspired by the paper "Tour merging via Branch decomposition" by Cook and Seymour.
The idea is to create a set of promosing tours using a hearistic (LKH) and then merge these tours and calculate the optimal tour in the resulting graph. This can be done efficiently because the merged tour (probably) has a small tree width.

Requires LKH-2.0.7 source files in a subfolder lkh-src of src and the header files in a subfolder lkh-include of include (http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/).
